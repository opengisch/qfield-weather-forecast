# QField Weather Forecast Plugin

This [QField](https://github.com/opengisch/QField/) plugin delivers weather
forecast directly on top of the map canvas, giving users an up-to-date
overview of the weather to come while working in the field.

The plugin utilises [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/)'s open source and
free to use weather API.
